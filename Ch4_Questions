1- what is a file descriptor and in what ways can it be handled in Python?
A: Opened file is essentially represented by an integer. This integer acts as a reference point that the program can use in order
    to have access to that file.  Open or with statement

2- what problem arises when file descriptors are not handled carefully?
A: file descriptor leakage

3- what is a lock and in what ways can it be handled in Python?
A: A mechanism in concurrent and parallel programming that are typically used to synchronize threads in multithreaded application.
    x_lock = threading.Lock()
    x_lock.acquire()
    x_lock.release()

4- what problem arises when locks are not handled carefully?
A: deadlock, program will hang forever

5- what is the idea behind context managers?
A: Manage resources properly where resources are shared across different entities in the concurrent or parallel application.

6- what options does the with statement in Python provide in terms of context management?
A: with exp1 as target1, exp2 as target2:
        [code]
