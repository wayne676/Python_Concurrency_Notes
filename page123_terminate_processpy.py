'''
p.terminate()
When terminate a process, descendant processes of the terminated process will not be terminated. They are known as 
orphaned processes.
One thing to note when using terminate(), it is important to call join() on the object as well. Since the alive status of Process
objects is sometimes not immediately updated after the terminate()
