1- What is a reduction operator? What ocnfitions mube be satisfied so that an operator can be reduction one?
A: Take a set or an array of elements and perform some form of computation to return only one single result

2- What properties do reduction operators have that are equivalent to the required conditions?
A: a- Operator can reduce an array of elements into one scalar value
   b- End result mube be obtained through creating and computing partial tasks (分组操作)

3- What is the connection between reduction operators and concurrent programming?
A: Computation of any reduction operator to be able to be divided into smaller partial computations

4- What are some of the considerations that must be made while working with multiprocessing programs that facilitate interprocess
    communication in Python
A: double .get() and .task_done()

5- What are some real-life applications of concurrent reduction operators?
A: NumPy, bitwise: finite state machines, communication across sockets/ports, compression and encryption
